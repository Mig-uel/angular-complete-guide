  <!-- @if is a conditional rendering syntax -->

  <!-- 
    prior to Angular 17, we had to use the *ngIf directive for conditional rendering.

    *ngIf is a structural directive that changes the DOM structure by adding or removing elements based on a condition.

<!-- 
  In modern Angular, there are no more structural directives like *ngIf or *ngFor.
